### Hi, I'm Erik 🙃

- 📚  Learning SwiftUI and Flutter sometines 
- 📱  I develop a simple app called [Verbs!][1] ( because I didn't found a simple app for practice verbs in their differents forms 🤷🏻‍♂️ and because I'm developer 😆 )(currently out of the store)
- Also in android [Verbs!][2] / [Verbs2!][3] (This version was made in compose) (I've replicated the same app because I've concider it was a good chance to learn the basics of android)
